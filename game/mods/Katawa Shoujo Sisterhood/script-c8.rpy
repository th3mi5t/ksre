hi "The right one, focus on the right one!"

ha "Y-yes!"

"I aim my gun and a moment later the cyborg who just ambushed us from the nearby niche goes down in a hail of sparks."

"In the meantime, Hisao is struggling to hit another cyborg shooting at us from a vehicle straight ahead, but he has difficulty getting a clear shot due to several allied soldiers running ahead of us and blocking the line of fire."

hi "Cover me, Corporal Ikezawa!"

"I giggle, more than eager to play along."

ha "A-affirmative, Sergeant Nakai."

"We take aim at the main attacker and unleash a torrent of bullets onto his head and chest."

"\"Mission cleared!\""

"At the mechanical announcement, we both drop the gun-shaped controllers we've been holding while the next mission starts loading up."

ha "H-Hisao?"

hi "Yeah?"

ha "Have you played these kinds of games before?"

hi "Before I had my heart attack, I sometimes visited game centers with friends. These rail shooters were among the kinds of things we used to play."

hi "The ones I played were much more primitive than this one though. Technology sure speeds along."

"\"Get ready!\""

"As another droning announcement indicates we're about the start the next level, we take up the gun units again and ready them."

hi "You know, I never suspected that the next time I'd be visiting a game center, it'd be as part of a date."

"I smile. An arcade center isn't exactly a place the average teenager would take his girlfriend to, but I guess I'm not exactly the average girlfriend either. In a way, it was a pretty clever idea on Hisao's part."

"While there are quite a few people around, the hall itself is rather dark so my scarring isn't very noticeable, especially since I'm also wearing my hat. And while we're playing games, there's no need for small talk."

ha "I…I really like it so far."

"This time we're on top of some vehicle chasing an enemy truck."

hi "Have you played many video games in the past, Hanako?"

"Several enemy troops appear on the roof of the truck and start shooting at us. We quickly return fire, each of us trying to focus on different enemies."

ha "N-not many. We had an old Super Famicom at the orphanage that was donated by one of the staff members whose son was given a more recent system for his birthday. It was pretty popular with the other kids, so I didn't get around to using it very often."

"We clear the roof of the truck. Now what?"

hi "They have a retro section here as well. We could check it out later. We might run into some familiar titles."

ha "Sure."

"Suddenly explosive charges are being tossed at us from inside the truck. A big blast and our life meters drop down by 20%."

hi "Hey, how the heck are we supposed to deal with that?"

"We both try shooting the vehicle, but nothing happens. Another charge is tossed and now our life meters are at 60%."

ha "T-the tires perhaps?"

"Again, nothing. Another charge gets tossed, but as Hisao shoots at it, it explodes prematurely and the enemy truck shakes from the blast."

hi "We're supposed to shoot the charges before they reach us!"

"Another charge gets tossed. This time I intercept it and the truck shakes even more."

hi "Good shot, Hanako."

ha "They're always coming from the same point."

"Another charge is blown, but this time the truck starts moving from side to side."

hi "Oh come on!"

"We miss the next two charges and now we're at 20%. Hisao gets the next one and the back of the truck ignites."

ha "D-did we do it?"

"Then one more charge is thrown from the burning truck, the screen turns red and a big countdown appears."

hi "Blast!"

"I hastily reach for my purse and take out a coin, so we can continue. But as I bend down to slide it into the slot…"

ha "Ouch!"

hi "OW!!!"

"Something hits me in the head, causing me to drop the coin. I quickly get down on my knees to retrieve it before it rolls under one of the cabinets. As I grab it and look behind me, two things draw my attention."

"One is the arcade cabinet we were standing in front of with a big \"GAME OVER\" message on the screen."

"The other is my boyfriend, also kneeling on the floor and looking at the screen, then looking at me. His one hand is holding a coin as well. His other hand is rubbing his forehead."

"As the ridiculousness of the situation sinks in, I press my hand to my mouth in order to stifle a burst of laugher that would surely attract the attention of the other people around us. Hisao merely chuckles while wearing a silly grin on his face."

"We both did the exact same thing at the exact same time."

"Hisao lets out a resigned sigh."

hi "I don't know about you, but I don't feel like playing through those previous stages again. Let's go and do something else."

ha "O-okay."

"I look at Hisao as he makes his way past the rows of arcade machines with me in tow. He's not wearing the usual sweater vest he usually has on when not wearing his school uniform. Instead, he's wearing a shirt I picked out for him during our shopping trip in Hokkaido."

"I kinda like the way it looks on him, though I suspect he's also wearing it to stand out less in our current environment. As we reach a quieter area, Hisao suddenly stops. This corner of the hall contains several air hockey tables."

hi "Wanna play a little match, Hanako?"

ha "Sure."

"I walk over to the table closest to the corner and insert a coin. The table hums to life, the display on the rail around the playing field lights up to reveal two zeros, and a cool breeze starts to blow on the table's surface."

"I look around to confirm no other people are in the immediate vicinity and use my hair clip to move my hair lock out of the way just enough to prevent it from creating a blind spot in my peripheral vision. I pick up a mallet, take the puck from the tray beneath my goal and place it on the table."

ha "Ready, Hisao?"

hi "Bring it on."

"I launch the puck towards him. He hits it towards the right railing. I deflect the puck with more luck than skill. Then he sends the puck straight ahead before I can react."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"1:0"

"I fish the puck out of my tray and place it in front of my mallet again."

hi "Hey Hanako, it wasn't necessary for you to pay up back there."

"I bat the puck across the field. It ricochets off his mallet and goes straight towards me again. I aim for the left rail and hit the puck towards it."

ha "But you were the one who paid for the first credit."

"{i}tic - TSCHAK{/i}"

"1:1"

hi "I offered to foot the bill for this entire visit, didn't I?"

ha "Y-you really don't have to."

"I launch the puck towards him again, but this time he tilts his mallet causing the puck to get stuck under it."

"Isn't that officially a foul?"

hi "You'd rather I didn't or you really don't want me to?"

ha "Huh?"

hi "That day we started our relationship, you were worried that you were useless. That you weren't able to do anything for the people you cared about. Do you still feel that way?"

"He takes his mallet off the puck and gently bats it in my direction. I stop it with my hand, take aim and hit it towards the rail near me, causing it to fly across the field in a frantic zigzag, but he catches it and hits it back in a similar manner." 

"I try to deflect it, but accidentally bounce it into my own goal."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"2:1"

ha "I'm not really sure. I… don't… think… I… do."

"He picks up the puck and launches it towards the right rail, but this time I deflect it towards the left rail in time. He hits it under the same angle and we repeat this pattern several times until I change the angle just a little bit and the puck slides into his goal."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"2:2"

hi "I don't think there's need to doubt yourself. I mean, we often study together. You supported me in getting into the science club. And I have lots of fun hanging out with you."

ha "S-so, isn't everything okay then?"

"He bats the puck hard into my left corner so it bounces out of my reach before I can react. Then the right corner. Then the left again. Then the right."

"As I move my mallet to the left in order to catch where I predict the puck will go next, he sends a straight shot right into my goal."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"3:2"

hi "There's something I noticed lately. Something about our relationship."

"I try the zigzag shot again. He deflects it, so I try the zigzag on the other rail. This breaks through his guard."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"3:3"

ha "W-what is it?"

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"4:3"

hi "Whenever I help you with your science homework…"

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"4:4"

hi "…you insist on doing some Japanese exercises with me in return."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"5:4"

hi "Whenever I give you a shoulder rub to ease your stress…"

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"5:5"

hi "…you insist on returning the favor, even if I'm not stressed myself."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"6:5"

#show hisao basic_frown with charachange

hi "Whenever we go on a date…"

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"6:6"

hi "…you always insist on paying at least half. Even if I say the whole thing's on me."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"7:6"

hi "What's wrong with having a give-and-receive relationship?"

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"7:7"

"Hisao takes the puck out of the tray, but doesn't immediately place it onto the field."


hi "It feels off sometimes. As if you're keeping a tally. Trying to carefully balance things out each time.Making sure you never receive more than you give. That's not a give-and-receive relationship. That's more like a give-and-pay-back-relationship."

hi "I enjoy doing things for you, but only if you don't see those things as debts that must be paid off as quickly as possible."

"I fall silent as I try to recall those moments and what I felt at the time. Was it fear? Fear of us once more slipping into a caretaker-caretakee relationship if I didn't actively prevent it from happening? Fear of me depending more on him than him on me? Fear of being deemed useless?"

"I feel embarrassed upon being called out on this, as if I got caught with my hand in a cookie jar."

hi "You have faith in me, don't you Hanako? I'm not gonna walk out on you just like that. I feel there's a whole lot more between us than just a list of favors and counter favors. This isn't how intimate relationships are supposed to work."

"I know that, of course. Just like I know that whenever I have to pass through a crowd, the odds of everyone in there noticing my scarring at exactly the same moment and all of them staring at me at once is pretty close to non-existent, but I'm still terrified of it happening."

"None of my anxieties really make sense from a rational point of view, but that doesn't make them any less real for me. If Miss Yumi is to be believed, anxieties don't go away overnight just like that, nor can they be dismissed with logic."

"What was it she said? Something about the heart not listening to reason, only to experiences?"

"I watch Hisao place the puck back on the table and prepare for another assault. We pass it back and forth several times before it slips past my mallet."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"8:7"

hi "I'm not saying I don't enjoy getting a backrub in return on occasion, but it shouldn't be mandatory."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"9:7"

hi "I really enjoy the lunches you bring along for me every so often. I'm not sure if you were expecting…"

ha "No, no, no, no, no… I really d-don't need you to r-return the favor. I r-really enjoy m-making them ffor you."

"As I blurt out a denial of his suggestion, the puck zips into my goal slot. Looks like Hisao made his winning point."

"{i}TSCHAK{/i}"

"10:7"

hi "Just like I enjoy doing things for you on occasion. Giving and receiving can both be fun in their own way. I don't think we should keep score… Trying to keep things exactly even will only make our relation appear rigid and unnatural."

"I nod. I understand what he's trying to tell me."

ha "I-I have faith in you, Hisao. Do you also h-have faith in me?"

#show hisao basic_smile with charachange

hi "I do, Hanako."

ha "I-I'm trying, and I promise to t-try even harder from n-now on."

"Hisao walks over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder."

"That's enough for me, Hanako. Thanks."

#show hisao basic_grin with charachange

"He gives me a sly grin."

hi "We could give a try right now if you like."

ha "Ummm… what do you mean?"

hi "Would you be okay if I foot the bill for the rest of the evening? Or at least the majority of it?"

"Not really. I really want to show Hisao I got the point he was trying to make earlier, but I want to share in the costs too, if possible. Suddenly, an idea pops into my head."

ha "Ummm… I have another idea. W-we could play rock-paper-scissors before we start a game. The winner p-pays until we move on. S-so if you win every contest, you cover the entire evening."

hi "And if you win every time, everything'll be on you, right?"

ha "That's right. But I p-promise I'll accept the outcome, no matter w-what it is."

hi "Okay then. But perhaps we can do something more practical than rock-paper-scissors. Something that never results in a tie."

ha "What do you suggest?"

hi "How about flipping a coin?"

ha "O-okay."

"We decide on sides and then head over to the retro section Hisao brought up earlier."
