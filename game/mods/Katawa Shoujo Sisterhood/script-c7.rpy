"Ten more minutes until lunch break. We've already completed the assignment we were given, so now I've taken out one of my library books and am trying to finish a chapter before the school bell rings."

"Truth be told I'm still a little tense, so it's not going as quickly as I had been hoping for."
    
"The reason for the tension I feel is the fact I just completed my first group assignment in class (the occasional assignments Hisao and I do together notwithstanding)."

"Or rather, my first group assignment that didn't end in disaster, like some time ago in science class, when I was struck with a panic attack."

"And Hisao wasn't even part of the group I worked with today, or things probably would have been less awkward."

"Today in Japanese class, we were instructed to work in groups of three people maximum and write a short piece on parliament elections."

"Hisao immediately got up to join me, only to be pushed back into his seat by Misha and being forced into a heated discussion about having dodged a student council assignment the other day."

"I don't think it was meant to be a public argument, but Misha is very easy to eavesdrop on."

"I was familiar enough with Shizune and Misha (as well as Hisao's playfully tense relationship with them) to figure out that they were going to use that group assignment as an excuse to drag a promise out of him to make up for it somehow."

"That meant the chances of Hisao doing group work with me just dropped to exactly zero. A suspicion confirmed by an apologetic shrug on his part."

"Just as I got ready to start the assignment on my own, I noticed Hisao was making a gesture with his head towards a point to my right."

"I followed his gaze and noticed my two neighbors on the right side were the only students not part of a group of three yet. My eyes grew wide as I realized his intention."

"Was he telling me to join some other group just like that? I quickly shook my head and gave him a begging look, but he just made a gesture towards Shizune as if to say 'matters are out of my hands'."

"Later on, I started wondering whether he was really unable to ditch the student council duo or whether this was a subtle attempt on his part to help me widen the circle of people I could have social interaction with."

"I took another look at my neighbors only to quickly look away when they caught my gaze. I looked back at Hisao again, and this time he was smiling at me." 

"I knew that expression; I came to know it as his 'everything will be alright'-smile. It didn't do a lot to inspire confidence in me this time, though."

"In all my time in this class, I could count the words I exchanged with my neighbors on one hand, and I had no clue why they would even want to work with me after I spent the better part of two years trying to avoid even basic interaction with them."

ha "Ummm…"

"As usual when faced with an unexpected social situation, my mind completely froze up, and I couldn't come up with even a single way to formulate that simple request that most people could make without even having to think about it." 

"The fact that my neighbor is a very outgoing person herself didn't exactly ease my mind."

ha "E-exc…e-excuse me..."

"That got their attention. The girls looked at me, and when I didn't reply, they looked at Hisao who gave them a quick nod. My neighbor gave me a cheerful grin."

mk "Looking for a group to work with, Ikezawa?"

"I gave them a timid nod."

mk "No probs. Feel free to tag along. Three know more than two, right?"
As I moved my desk over to theirs, my neighbor Naomi wasted no time in making conversation.
"Bet you were disappointed you couldn't work with Nakai this time, weren't you? You two usually do
assignments together these days. Heh, I guess the powers that be decided otherwise, didn't they?"
Am I really supposed to answer all of that?
"You're usually not big on group work, aren't you? Didn't something happen that time before in science
class? Don't worry, stuff like that happens to the best of us. But you know that, don't you? You're
usually stuck with the front row seat when I short out."
The last statement was accompanied by a cheerful wink.
Too many questions!
While I was still reeling from Naomi's verbal machinegun fire, her neighbor Natsume cut in with a
question of her own.
"Japanese is one of your stronger subjects, is it not?"
