tak "Come in, please!"

"After I hear the reply to my knocking, I hesitantly open the door leading into the 'office' where I have my sessions every other week."
 
"Office isn't really a good word to describe it. Den or living room seem more appropriate. Miss Yumi has very peculiar tastes when it comes to her work place."

yumi "Good day, Miss Hanako."

ha "G-good day, Miss Yumi."

"As I enter, Miss Yumi gets up, approaches me and we exchange greetings and polite bows."

yumi "May I have the honor of getting you some tea, Miss Hanako?"

ha "I-I humbly accept, Miss Yumi."

"The little ritual we practice at the start of every session is a bit old-fashioned, just like the room and Miss Yumi herself. But it serves its purpose well."
 
"Since it's exactly the same every time, I can simply repeat the phrases I always use without having to think too hard about how to respond. (Which usually causes me to start stuttering)"

"A small bowl of tea is gently placed in my hands, and after a small bow, we both take a careful drink."

"When I was admitted to this school, the head nurse explained to me the teachers were not going to make a fuss if I felt anxious and wanted to leave class to catch my bearings. However, he also mentioned he was assigning me one of the therapists at school for sessions outside of school hours."

"I sensed that they expected me to go along with this in return for the lenience I'd receive in regard to my school attendance, so I reluctantly accepted."

"My first therapist was a middle-aged man with thick glasses and a scruffy beard. He was polite enough, but also really intimidating. I always felt a bit like a research specimen during our sessions."

"Eventually I was referred to another person; a rather young man with a stubble, sneakers and an awful sweater. He was nice enough, but I always felt uneasy around him."

"The third person was Miss Takawa, who was new to Yamaku at the time. She told me I could start calling her Miss Yumi as a sign of trust once I felt we established such a thing and since a few weeks I've been calling her that."

#show takawa basic_grin with charachange

yumi "Well then, shall we start?"

ha "Y-yes, please."

"Miss Yumi gives a small nod, and I place the first black stone onto the game board. Miss Yumi takes one of her white stones and puts it in place with a dull tap."

#show takawa basic_neutral with charachange

yumi "So, Miss Hanako, how have you been sleeping lately?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

ha "Not t-too badly."

"We usually have an agreement that only the person whose turn it is is allowed to speak. If I want things to slow down, I can simply wait a bit before placing my next stone."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "That's good to hear. May I suggest we try a week without sleeping pills again and see if things remain that way? The worst weeks should be behind us for now."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

ha "If you say so."

"Miss Yumi is an enthusiastic Go player, and ever since our third meeting we've been playing as part of our session."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "If we can get you your daily eight hours of sleep again without any medication, then that's a goal we should not pass up."

yumi "If you still have bad dreams three weeks after…that day…you could try some herbal tea. I happen to know a recipe that tends to work very well."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

ha "O-okay then."

"I don't think I actually relax while playing games, as Miss Yumi thought at first. It's quite the opposite…I grow more focused than usual."

"But since I get to focus on something other than my anxiety, my head tends to be clearer, and I'm less nervous in my interactions."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "If you were a little older, I could recommend a few sips of sake as well, but I don't think that'd be a good idea right now."

#show takawa basic_grin with charachange

yumi "If the principal were to find out, these old bones would be dragged onto the street in a heartbeat."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"I suppress a small giggle. While Miss Yumi is always a bit formal, she's not always serious and is quick to fill the silences with some small talk whenever I don't have much to say myself."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "So, how is life in the dorms these days?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

ha "S-same as always. Except the girl in the room next to mine has moved out recently."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "I see. Have you ever spoken to her?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"Not that I can remember. SHE tried to speak to ME though, around the time I moved in here."

"Or rather, barged into my room and pretended living next to each other was enough to make us instant buddies. I've kept my door locked ever since."

ha "N-no. I haven't."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "So I suppose you can expect to get a new neighbor soon. I doubt the housing department will leave that room empty for long."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"That would be too much to hope for."

ha "Maybe."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

#show takawa basic_smile with charachange

yumi "Maybe even someone nice."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"Hopefully nice enough to ignore me instead of staring at me."

ha "Maybe."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "That's not a bad move, Miss Hanako. You're getting much better at this."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"She's just flattering me. While it's nice to play against her, I haven't beaten her a single time. She's a formidable player and doesn't feel the need to hold back for her opponent's sake."

ha "N-not really."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

#show takawa basic_calculating with charachange

yumi "I have the not-very-scientific belief that it's possible to deduce certain personality aspects of a person through their playing style while they're still learning the ropes of a game."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"What does that say about me? Has she been analyzing me through this? Like a creative variation of a typical question form?"

ha "R-really?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "Your defensive playing style fits your personality, Miss Hanako. Am I right to assume your favorite chess strategies also focus on defense?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"That's a pretty good deduction. Am I really that predictable?"

ha "That's…right."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "But pure defense will never win you anything. At best, it results in a stalemate."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"Isn't that still better than losing? Is she saying I should go on the offensive instead? That'd just get me beaten sooner."

ha "S-should I play aggressively then?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "Playing aggressively doesn't suit you. It would be better for you to stick to what comes naturally to you and improve upon it."

yumi "A good offensive player forces opportunities. A good defensive player takes advantage of opportunities as they arise."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"Are we still talking about Go here?"

ha "Ah…"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "We could practice it if you'd like. I'm going to leave you a few openings now and then and it's up to you to spot them and exploit them as quickly as you can."

#show takawa basic_smile with charachange

"She smiles as her eyes scan the board."

yumi "You might find that games like these and life in general have quite a few parallels."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"I just nod and try to focus on the result of Miss Yumi's latest move. Am I already supposed to look for openings?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "By the way, Miss Hanako, I almost forgot to tell you that I will be on leave for the next two weeks. So our next session will be in twenty-one days."

"If anything happens, you can always contact the head nurse here. I have no plans to take any trips, so he should have no problems getting in touch with me in the unlikely case of an emergency."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"That news makes me feel sad. I didn't think about it at first, but I've come to enjoy these sessions."

"I can be on my own just fine most of the time without feeling miserable, but now that I'm being told I'll have to wait for three weeks before we'll get to talk and play games again, I suddenly start to feel lonely."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"She said she's not going to be away from home."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"Should I ask if I can visit her sometime? Just to play a few more games?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"What if she rejects me?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

"She's an adult. She has been for a long time."

"She's different from my old schoolmates."

"We get along well."

"She doesn't mind my scars."

"{i}Tap{/i}"

yumi "Is something bothering you, Miss Hanako?"

"{i}Tap{/i}"

ha "Umm…I…"

"My social anxiety, which usually remains subdued during these sessions, has just returned in full force and is threatening to choke me." 

"As my breathing starts speeding up, Miss Yumi places her bowl in front of me and then gets up to get the kettle from the brazier in the corner."

yumi "Don't force yourself, dear. Take a sip, a few deep breaths, close your eyes and think of a clear sky or flowing water."

"Just a few sentences. I can do this."

ha "M-Miss Yumi…c-c-can I…c-c-come o-over n-next…w-week and p-p-play a…a g-game w-with y-y-you?"

#show takawa basic_cold with charachange

"Miss Yumi merely looks at me with an unreadable expression on her face. Or rather, stares at me."

yumi "Come over next week, you say?"

"Don't tell me she didn't understand. Did I really cut such a pathetic figure? I gather all of what's left of my rapidly vaporizing determination and force myself to smile at her."

ha "M-m-Miss Yumi…c-c-can I b-be…b-b-be f-f-friends w-with you?"

"I exhale deeply. I said it. I didn't think I could do it, but I said it."

"But strangely enough, Miss Yumi doesn't react. As I look at her, I still see that same neutral expression on her face."

"Just when I'm about to ask her if she's heard me (I don't think I could bear to repeat my question), she slowly starts speaking."

#show takawa basic_smile with charachange

yumi "Miss Hanako, your friendship is the second most valuable gift in the world you can offer another person…and a priceless gift it is."

#show takawa basic_downsmile with charachange

"Her gaze suddenly lowers and shifts to one of the corners of the table. A feeling of dread starts to well up inside me."

"Miss Yumi shuts her eyes for a few seconds and then forces herself to look right at me."

yumi "I am very sorry that I cannot possibly accept it."

ha "Of…of course not."

"I try to think of something more to say. Some way to change the subject. But I can't."

"Of course she wouldn't want me around. Who would want to spend time with a useless person like me?"

"She's only tolerating me because she's being paid for it."

"I have to get out of here."

"I feel a lump in my throat. I desperately try to swallow it."

"I have to get out of here."

"I squeeze my eyes shut, but I can't prevent tears from rolling down my cheeks."

"I have to get out of here now."

#show takawa basic_sad with charachange

yumi "Miss Hanako…"

"Go somewhere. Anywhere. Away from here."

#show takawa basic_neutral with charachange

yumi "Miss Hanako…"

"Far away from here."

#show takawa basic_stern with charachange

yumi "Miss Hanako!"

"Miss Yumi's stern voice snaps me out of it. When I look at her, I notice she has a tissue in her hand which she offers me while her eyes look sadly, but compassionately at me."

#show takawa basic_gentle with charachange

yumi "Before you draw your own conclusions, please let me explain."

"Explain? Is this where she's going to make up excuses? Tell me she's not worthy or something?"

yumi "I'm not refusing your gift because I don't enjoy spending time with you or because you're not a sweet and caring girl. I do and you are."

yumi "I cannot accept your gift because… a friendship between us would be inappropriate."

"Inappropriate? You know what's inappropriate? Your friendliness! Playing games with me and acting all interested in me! Pretending that you care!"

"It's just a facade. Another tool to pry me open so you can take a look inside and determine just how broken things are!"

"I'm trying to restrain myself, but suddenly I feel furious. Before I can stop myself, I hiss a reply to her."

ha "I-I'm j-just another br-broken human being f-for you to f-fix."

#show takawa basic_netural with charachange

"I regret those vitriolic words the instant they leave my mouth, but Miss Yumi doesn't flinch. Instead, she refills the tea bowl and calmly looks back at me."

yumi "Supporting your recovery, or 'fixing you' to use your own words, is what I'm here for. It'd be disingenuous of me to pretend otherwise. I am a therapist after all."

"I freeze. That's not the reaction I expected at all."

yumi "Miss Hanako, the desire for friendship you expressed just now is undeniably a good thing, and I'd greatly encourage you to hold onto it, but not all friendships are undeniably good."

"Some friendships can be downright unhealthy. And friendships with therapists are the unhealthiest of them all."

ha "I…I don't understand."

#show takawa basic_smile with charachange

yumi "Friendship is a bond of mutually accepted equality, Miss Hanako. True friends are equals. Two people cannot be equals if one of them is being paid to spend time with the other."

yumi "Two people cannot be equals if one has learned the history of the other through a case file."

yumi "True friends are willing to share both each other's joy and each other's grief."

ha "And you… can't?"

yumi "As your therapist, I will be here as long as you need my help, but when you stop requiring that assistance… when you start getting better, people like me will start backing out of your life in order to shift their attention to those more in need of their presence. It's what a therapist does." 

yumi "It's not something a friend would ever do."

ha "So… Are you saying we cannot be friends? Ever?"

yumi "I believe that a good therapist will never try to become your friend, and a good friend will never try to become your therapist." 

yumi "No person should try to fulfill both roles for you. I believe I can serve you best as a therapist because we work well together… unless you can no longer believe in me after today."

ha "I…I'm not sure."

yumi "Please let me assure you right now, Miss Hanako, that still I believe in you. Just because I cannot be your friend doesn't mean I'm going to give up on you. I believe that you'll get the friendships you desire in time."

ha "W-why?"

yumi "Because I learned one more thing from watching you play."

ha "What's that?"

yumi "That you're not a quitter, even though life, like me, hasn't been going easy on you."

yumi "And because quitting is not in your character, you'll eventually come across the right opportunities."

"Now I believe she's merely trying to cheer me up. I really need some time alone at the moment. I get up to leave and Miss Yumi lets me go without protesting."


#show takawa basic_sad with charachange

"As I open the door and turn around to bid her farewell, Miss Yumi performs what has to be the deepest and most prolonged bow I've ever seen from her, and when she rises I'm shocked to see an expression of genuine sadness on her face."

yumi "Truth be told…I've been forced to have this talk with several people over the years, and it still breaks my heart every time I have to repeat it. I'm truly sorry, Hanako."
