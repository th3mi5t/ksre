"I lift my arm, hold my watch in front of my face and press a button on the side, causing the display to light up. I hear the soft voice of my girlfriend who's lying on the ground to my left."

ha "Hisao, what time is it?"

hi "It's nearly half past ten."

ha"Do you think we should head back?"

hi"Not yet. Lilly probably hasn't finished her book yet."

"A momentary silence. Silences around Hanako are sometimes uncomfortable, but right now they feel alright due how relaxing our surroundings are."

hi "Hanako?"

ha "Yes?"

hi "How many romance stories do you think have a chapter where a couple is lying in an open field gazing at the stars?"

"I hear an amused giggle from Hanako."

ha "I…I could name at least nine."

n "I suppose that would make us number ten. After getting up early - too early - yesterday morning we took the train to Hokkaido and arrived at the Satou summer home late in the afternoon."

n "I failed to get a great deal of sleep the night before, so I spent a large part of the evening napping while Lilly and Hanako cleaned up the house and made supper. I felt a bit guilty about it, but neither seemed to mind it very much."

n "The day afterwards, we walked to the nearby town which was more exhausting than I thought due to the heat. We had ice-cream to cool down once we reached our destination, and Hanako spent most of the time afterwards browsing clothes for Lilly, herself and me."

n "After a filling lunch in town and more shopping, we walked back to the summer home, had a delicious dinner and then went out for an evening walk while Lilly remained behind in order to finish the book she started on the train a day ago."

n "After lazily strolling through the surrounding area, we decided to take a break, and now we're lying side by side in the wheat field behind the summer home just staring at the sky."

"I sneak a sideway glance at Hanako, though I can't see her very well since it's already pretty dark, there isn't a single street lamp in a three mile radius and Hanako's face is partially obscured by several stalks of wheat."

ha "Umm…Hisao?"

hi "What is it?"

ha "What do you think of our trip so far?"

"I take a moment to think."

"We haven't really been doing anything spectacular ever since we got here… Lilly's blindness, my heart condition and Hanako's difficulty with crowds rule out a lot of activities, but somehow it hasn't detracted from the experience." 

"Something about our little outing feels… just right."

hi "I like it. A lot. I'm happy we got the opportunity to go here. It's nice to relax a bit after all the studying."

"Not to mention the stress related to other recent events."

"Hanako hesitates for a bit and then takes a deep breath."

ha "It…feels…like…"

hi "It feels like what?"

ha "It…feels like…I… have a family again…"

hi "A family huh?"

ha "Y-yes. A small disabled family, but a family all the same."

"I think about Hanako's words for a bit. The atmosphere between us really has felt like that over the last two days."

"The way Hanako and Lilly looked while preparing our meals together. The way we had breakfast and dinner together. The way we huddled on the couch while watching television together."

"The way we relaxed in the back yard, reading books or playing games. It all felt so strangely comfortable."

hi "I think I know what you mean."

show hanako basic_normal_cas_close 
with charachangealways

ha "You feel the same?"

hi "I think I do. I keep trying to imagine what this kind of trip would have been like with the friends I used to hang out with before I came to Yamaku, and I don't think things would have felt this… natural. This… homey."

ha "Maybe we both needed to be away from Yamaku for a while. To… you know… maybe… remember what it's like to be n-normal."

"That's a pretty good point Hanako is bringing up. When passing by students from other classes, I still tend to revert to thinking of them as \"that girl with the crutch\" or \"that guy who's missing several fingers\" from time to time, and  every time I catch myself, I'm reminded of my own condition."

"On the other hand, I'm now so familiar with both Lilly and Hanako that I find it harder and harder to see their condition as something out of the ordinary. It simply has become part of who they are in my mind."

"Life here has been very relaxed. Lilly's familiarity with the building has allowed her to get around without needing her cane." 

"Having no other people in a one-mile radius has allowed Hanako to relax to the point where she's been wearing her hairclip almost constantly, and although she's still not as chatty as Emi or Misha usually is, she's calm enough to hold conversations with us without her usual stammering."

"The only time I was reminded of my own condition was when I was forced to admit to Hanako yesterday evening that I hadn't thought about taking my medication for the day yet after she asked me about it."

"While taking my pills has become an automatism for me at Yamaku, I was confronted by the fact I become prone to forgetting about them when suddenly taken out of my usual daily routine."

"While I'm thankful that Hanako takes her promise of mutual support so seriously, I'm not thrilled by the prospect of her watching me like a hawk for the remainder of the trip. Still, her scolding was only a minor inconvenience."

hi "You're right. It's been months since I've felt this…normal."

ha "F-for me it's probably been years."

show hanako basic_distant_cas_close

"A silence. While she didn't sound sad while saying it, the reminder of how stagnant Hanako's life has been until recently depresses me a bit."

"Eager to steer the discussion away from that topic, I return to what we were talking about previously."

hi "So, if we're like a family, what would that make Akira? The loud and feisty aunt?"

show hanako emb_smile_cas_close
with charachangealways

"Hanako giggles at that mental image."

ha "Probably."

hi "And I guess Lilly would be the mother of the bunch?"

show hanako basic_normal_cas_close
with charachangealways

ha "N-no mother or father. Just Lilly, you and me."

"My question was merely in jest, so I raise an eyebrow at how seriously Hanako answers it."

"Does Hanako object to the suggestion of her and Lilly's relationship being like a mother-daughter relationship or does she think the idea of other people being like a mother or father figure is inappropriate since her own parents died?"

"If it's anything related to the latter, there's no way I'm going to explore that right now, lest I ruin her mood for the rest of our time here."

hi "Is Lilly like a sister to you then?"

ha "I… I can't really tell for sure. I was an only child, so I don't really know."

hi "Same here. We could have asked Lilly if she were here right now."

"Hanako lets out an audible sigh. I wouldn't be surprised if her thoughts are the same as mine right now."

ha "About Lilly… Have you noticed as well?"

hi "It'd be really hard to miss it. She's kind of acting like she accidentally joined us on our honeymoon."

"The length Lilly's going to to give Hanako and me private time together seems a bit much." 

"It's been mostly small things, like deciding to finish a book when we asked her to take a walk with us and suddenly wanting to take a break and catch a tan for an hour while we were in town, so Hanako and I could (or rather had to) do some shopping without her, but they have started adding up."

ha "Is she avoiding us?"

hi "Naw, she's just trying to give us some space. Wouldn't you do the same for her if it was her who just got a new boyfriend?"

ha "P-probably… Maybe. It's just that it feels like she's trying to get us to hook up even though we're already together. So I don't really understand."

"Good point. It's like she's trying to play match maker, which seemed strange since we have all the time in the world to do this at our own pace, and unlike her cousin, Lilly isn't really the type to try and hurry people along." 

"Then again, she did do something similar back when she had Akira take her and us tothat pool club in town in an attempt to get Hanako and me closer to each other."

hi "It's her motherly streak. She can get carried away with it at times. Just give it time. It'll probably blow over in a week or two."

ha "You're probably right."

n "We fall silent, neither of us really knowing how to continue the conversation. One thing remains on my mind. Even though most of Lilly's actions to give Hanako and me some time alone were rather small,
one of them was decidedly less so. When we arrived at the summer home and made preparations to unpack, Lilly gave us a small tour of the house ending up in the house's only bedroom; a fairly large room with a double bed near the window and a smaller single bed near the corner. 
She then dropped a bombshell by announcing that she herself would be using the convertible futon in the living room to spend the night on before casually walking out of the room, leaving Hanako beet red and me baffled at
this uncharacteristically unsubtle move on her part. I later questioned her about it, but she replied by
saying she wasn't forcing us to sleep in the same bed, and the sight of Hanako in her nightgown wasn't
anything new to me."

n "When I realized that in order to continue the discussion I'd have to get into how
far along Hanako and I were in that area, I decided not to paint myself into corner and dropped the
subject while I was still ahead. I was, of course, a gentleman, so Hanako was given the double bed
while I spent the first night in the smaller one. All in all, it was still a pretty comfortable place to
sleep."

n "Still, the question how far Hanako and I were in \"that\" area lingers on my mind. We have kissed each
other of course and sometimes shared a tight hug, but I'm not really sure if that was any indicator on
the rest. We slept together once, but Hanako merely initiated that because she thought it was the only
way to prevent me from drifting away from her, and she was so uncomfortable during the whole
experience that it is clear to me in hindsight that she certainly wasn't ready for the act itself."

nvl clear

n "Is having that kind of intimacy something Hanako will ever be doing for her own enjoyment to begin
with? We have never mentioned that night we spent together again after we started dating, and I don't
really know how Hanako sees sex. She isn't exactly a flirty person or someone who I'd expect to come
onto me of her own. How open to sex is Hanako when the threat of losing our friendship isn't looming
over her? Would she reluctantly offer herself to me again if I took the initiative out of fear that I might
lose interest in her otherwise rather than because she wants me? The only way to avoid that would be
to leave the initiative up to her, but that could again cause the risk of her making a move on me
because she feels she has to. If anything, our night together made things more complicated. I wonder if
there's an opportunity to talk to her about it without her freezing up in embarrassment. If anything,
I've learned over the last few weeks that making assumptions about Hanako isn't always the smartest
thing to do."

"I gently sit upright to look at Hanako. It's too dark to see her face clearly, but the fact she doesn't react to me staring at her suggests she has her eyes closed."

hi "Hanako."

ha "Yes?"

hi "You weren't sleeping, were you?"

ha "No, just relaxing a bit."

"Feeling a little playful, I pick up one of the straws that broke off when we sat down here and use it to gently tickle the side of Hanako's face. She doesn't react. I carefully move the straw closer to the center of her face." 

"When there's still no reaction and I start tickling her nose, she lets out a gasp, opens her eyes, puffs out her cheeks and blows the straw upwards."

hi "It wasn't exactly sudden. You just didn't react before."

ha "You t-touched the right side of my face, d-didn't you?"

hi "Y-yes."

ha "I…I…don't r-really feel anything there. Not anymore…"

"I feel the urge to punch myself. I really should have spotted that landmine from a mile away, and yet I happily pranced right onto it."

hi "I-I'm sorry, Hanako."

ha "It's t-the s-same for my right shoulder and arm and…*sigh*..well, y-you've seen it for yourself."

"I have. But I hadn't really thought much about the fact that a not insignificant part of her body was devoid of the sense of touch."

hi "You can't feel anything in any of those areas?"

ha "A-around some areas, I can f-feel it when you press hard enough. B-but nothing s-softer. N-not any pleasant sensations anymore."

"I wrap my arms around her. I start realizing why Hanako often hugged me so tightly when we exchanged kisses."

"Since the sensation on her back and shoulders was partially numbed, she had the tendency to press herself against me to maximize the sensations she was feeling from the front."

ha "I-It's p-probably for the better though. It c-could have been w-worse. I-It's better to feel n-nothing at all than to be in c-constant pain, i-isn't it?"

"That's true, but that can't feel like much of a consolation right now. I don't think it's going to do much good offering her sympathy. What she needs me to do right now is cheer her up."

"I think for a moment."

"I have an idea that might work, even if it's a bit of a gamble."

"It might also end up backfiring on me, but I decide to take the risk." 

"I sit a little bit closer to her."

hi "You know, maybe it's not as bad as you think it is."
