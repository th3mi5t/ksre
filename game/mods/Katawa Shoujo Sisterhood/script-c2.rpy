"I let out a loud yawn as I approach the running track wearing my gym shorts." 

"It has been a while since I wore them as I am still exempted from P.E. classes, and that running session during my first week was also the last time I made an active attempt to improve my health."

"Even then, it was mostly a desire to get the head nurse off my back that drove me to the running track. Today will be the first day I am here of my own free will."

"Two days ago, Hanako and I met in the park in an attempt to salvage our friendship, which had taken a turn for the extremely awkward after we spent the night with each other the evening before."
 
"If anything, our mutual confession highlighted just how riddled with misunderstandings and false assumptions our friendship had been up to that point, and clearing those up was a painful process for both of us."

"But it was also this very process that allowed the two of us to make a fresh start as boyfriend and girlfriend who made a promise of mutual support to each other."

"My new relationship with Hanako is also the reason I approached the nurse yesterday with a request for a training schedule."

"A week ago, I would have seen a heart flutter as something that was nobody's problem but my own, but now that I have a girlfriend I feel a newfound responsibility to stay in shape."

"The nurse had been quick to draw, in addition to his own conclusions about my motivations, a training regimen for me to follow."

"As I reach the track, I see a familiar girl sitting on the bleachers. As I approach, she looks up, gives me a wave and a smile and then continues adjusting the prosthetic running blades attached to the stumps just below her knees."

"I remember running with her on the track before, during my first week here. But since she's not in my class and I have spent most of my free time in the library, the tea room or my dorm, we haven't really talked much since then."

"I guess if my determination to get in shape holds out, we'll get to know each other better soon enough. According to the nurse, running is pretty much a daily ritual for Emi."

emi "Hey there! It's been forever since I've seen you here."

hi "Yeah, I've been making some early New Year resolutions and decided to make a serious attempt to get into shape."

"Emi gets up from the bleachers and bounces up and down on her leg blades a few times to test their stability."

emi "Nurse told me about your visit yesterday. He asked me to keep an eye on you, just in case something happens."

"She looks at me quizzically."

emi "What exactly was he talking about?"

"I take a moment to consider how to reply. When I first started attending here, I felt like my arrhythmia was none of other people's business, but over time I've slowly gotten more comfortable with it."

"At this point a few of my classmates know about it. It is probably best to give Emi a run-down of the situation, just in case something does happen."

hi "I'm at this school because I have a heart condition, so for me shaping up is more about avoiding sudden death than it is about avoiding weight gain."

hi "Until recently, I just walked some short distances every now and then, but I recently picked up dating, so I have an additional reason to improve my health and stay in shape. I'd hate to leave a grieving girlfriend behind."

"Emi responds with a smile, but suddenly makes wide eyes and mouths a soundless \"ahah\" as if she just had a revelation of some kind."

emi "Ohhh, so THAT was what the nurse was talking about."

hi "What exactly did he tell you?"

"Emi strikes a pose, puts her hands in the pockets of an imaginative coat and squeezes her eyes shut while contorting her face in a grin that is as wide as it is artificial."

emi "I have reason to believe young Hisao is being driven by the oldest motivation known to man."

"I don't know whether to be amused by Emi's over-the-top (but still frighteningly accurate) imitation of the nurse or annoyed by the insinuation she's making."

hi "I don't really see what's wrong with the desire to stay alive."

"Emi gives me an impish smile that indicates she really isn't buying my attempt to sidestep her remark."

emi "I think he was talking about sex, Hisao. You know, keeping the species going and all?"

hi "Whatever. Can we save the rest of the small talk for the cool down lap?"

"That sounded a little bit grumpier than I intended, but Emi doesn't seem to pay it any heed and cheerfully accepts my suggestion to start the morning run."

"The laps around the track actually turn out better than I expected. The last time I participated in this activity took place a week after I was released from the hospital, and my physical condition was outright pathetic."

"Nowadays, my condition is sufficient to allow me to walk from town back to school without feeling like an old man afterwards. Though I recently discovered it still wasn't good enough."

"I wonder how Emi and the nurse would react if they knew their teasing had an element of truth in it."

"Getting healthy enough to have sex wasn't the only reason behind my resolve to start working out, but the brief hiccup my heart experienced during the night Hanako and I slept together was enough to scare us both for a moment." 
"My condition hanging over our newly formed relationship like a dark cloud was something I wanted to avoid at all costs."

"Emi politely waited for me at the finish line, and now we are casually doing our cool down lap. She doesn't waste any time bringing up a subject to talk about."

emi "So, Hisao…are the rumors I've heard true?"

hi "What rumors would that be?"

emi "Don't tell me you don't know. I don't keep up with gossip much, and even I have heard about it."

"I sigh. Of course I knew."

"After Hanako and I bared our souls to one another in the park and we were walking through town to get something to drink, Hanako gave me what she called her first gift to me: a sweet kiss on the lips that marked the official start of our relationship."

"But it turned out that our little public display of affection had been spotted by some fellow students, and a day later the rumor mill was working overtime spreading the news throughout the hallways of Yamaku."

hi "What have you heard?"

emi "About Hanako Ikezawa… kissing someone in the middle of the street… a transfer student."

hi "Guilty as charged. Is that enough for you?"

emi "I bet I'm not the first one to bother you about this, am I?"

hi "More like the sixth. Which isn't too bad. Given the fact the entire school seems to know about it, I was prepared for more interrogations than I've received so far."

"As we finish our lap, we walk to the bleachers and take a few sips from the water bottles we brought along. We sit down for a moment, and Emi gently starts rubbing the spots where her legs meet her prosthetics."

emi "The rumor's not really about you, you know. I mean, you're just a new transfer student. But Hanako's been the shyest girl in school for the better part of three years. It's no wonder people talk about something like this."

hi "It's surprising so many people seem to know her, given the effort she usually makes to avoid drawing attention to herself."

emi "I don't think anyone except you and Lilly Satou really know her. But I bet most students know who she is. Sometimes, when you try hard enough to avoid being noticed, you end up standing out all the more."

show emi basic_happy_gym onlayer master

"We get up and take another sip. Emi lets out a cute little belch that most people would only associate with infants and we start walking towards the staff building."

emi "How did she react to the attention?"

hi "She hates it. What did you expect? Before, she merely thought people were staring at her all the time. Now, she KNOWS people are staring. She's been ditching the last few minutes of every class so far in an attempt to avoid the crowds."

"Emi looks down for a moment as she hears this. She gives me a sad smile."

emi "That's too bad. I mean, I get that she hates people staring, but I don't think this kind of attention is a bad thing. It's a shame she can't enjoy it."

hi "What do you mean?"

emi "Every student here has baggage of some kind. Some have gotten accustomed to things, but others are still working on it. But we all have…you know…milestones we have reached or still want to reach."

"She lightly taps her right leg blade in order to accentuate her point."

emi "When I first heard the rumor, I was reminded of the time I took my first few steps with these. Or the first time I successfully navigated a staircase." 

emi "For people like me, it brings back a pleasant memory. For people who are still coping, it's a little glimmer of hope, I think."

emi "Anyway, maybe I'm too optimistic, but I think right now most students, even though they don't know her, are genuinely happy for her. If she doesn't realize that and can't enjoy that, she's missing out."

"Emi's words sound oddly logical to me. Without exception, all students here must have dealt with hardships in their life, some more than others."

"Hanako's act was an undeniable sign of recovery, and no doubt something that would resonate with a lot of people here. I smile at Emi appreciatively."

hi "That actually makes a lot of sense. I don't think it'll change the way she feels about this, but I bet it'll make her feel a little bit better when I tell her. You know, you're a lot deeper than I expected."

"Emi looks annoyed at this."

"Emi laughs at me calling her bluff and as she opens the door of the nurse's office she playfully pokes me in the ribs with her finger."

emi "Let's hope you still have that drive tomorrow morning. The second days are always the worst ones."

"After delivering that ominous premonition, she closes the door behind her."
