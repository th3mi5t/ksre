"After listening for a moment, the nurse puts away his stethoscope and gives a satisfied nod to indicate I can put my shirt back on."

nk "You sound good to me. No chest pains or dizziness this morning?"

"I shake my head. I've been doing these morning jogs for several days now, and so far my heart hasn't acted up a single time despite the exhaustion I feel at the end of each practice session."

nk "And what do you think of the coach I assigned you?"

hi "When I got overconfident and tried to keep up with her yesterday morning, she immediately started yelling at me to stick to my schedule. She can be pretty intimidating despite her short stature."

"The nurse laughs at this."

nk "Is that a compliment?"

hi "I can't really complain about her. She can be harsh, but fair and pretty fun to chat with. Why are you so interested?"

"As I finish putting my shirt back on, the nurse leans in and speaks in a conspiring tone."

nk "The reason I asked her to get this involved with your practice sessions is because I want to know how open she is to the idea of using her athletic experience to help others."

nk "Running has always been a solitary thing for her, so it would be good if she took a liking to this whole coaching gig, as informal as it is."

hi "Are you hoping she'll want to turn it into a career?"

"He gives me a sheepish look."

nk "Graduation is less than a year away, and Emi doesn't have any clear plans on what to do afterwards. She kind of likes to live by the day. She's not exactly a bookworm if you know what I mean. But sports are something she's genuinely passionate about."

"You don't have to tell me that."

hi "Are you trying to talk her into becoming a trainer or a coach? Aren't those usually retired athletes?"

nk "More like a P.E. teacher. She might make a lively colleague, don't you think?"

"The nurse suddenly looks pensive and snaps his fingers with a guilty look on his face."

nk "Speaking of whichâ€¦that reminds me. A colleague of mine has been asking me about you and wanted to meet you. Do you have some time to spare later this day?"

hi "I have obligations today, but that's early in the evening. I could manage right after the last class. But what is this about?"

"Today is a special day as Lilly called us from Scotland a few days ago, saying she and Akira would be flying in today, and Hanako and I are planning to welcome them back. But I'm pretty curious why someone on Yamaku's staff would call on the nurse to arrange a meeting."

"I don't recall getting particularly bad marks lately, and even if that were the case, a teacher would be more likely to approach Mutou or Shizune in order to get in touch with me."

nk "Just an informal chat, I've been told. If you could drop by after your last class ends, that'd be great."

"That isn't a satisfying answer at all, but I still need to get back to the dorms and take a shower before class, so I leave the office without prying any further."

"After class, as I reach the corridor leading to the nurse's office, I can see he's already waiting for me outside. He greets me with his usual fox-like smile."

"He leads me through a few hallways and up two sets of stairs to a part of the staff building I've never been to before."

"He stops at a door at the end of one of the hallways and knocks loudly before opening it and making an inviting gesture like a porter beckoning a guest."

nk "After you."

"I expected to see just another office on the other side of the door; a variation of the nurse's home turf, but the room I step into fits neither a medical staff building nor a school."
 
"The best way to describe it would be a rather old-fashioned living room filled with nothing but wooden furniture and curtains in a style similar to ones my grandparents used to own. The only piece of technology in plain sight is the phone on a small table in one of the corners."

"As much out of place as the room feels in the building we're in, I have to admit it fits its sole occupant like a glove. Behind the table in the middle of the room sits a short old lady who looks like she's in her late fifties or even her early sixties. She's dressed in a violet shawl and a long black skirt, and her graying hair is held back in a bun."

"The nurse seems amused by my surprised reaction and puts his hand on my shoulder in an overly personal fashion."

nk "I feel that over the last few days we've grown close enough to each other for me to introduce you to my mother."

"Before I can fully digest his extremely out-of-place joke, the old lady behind the table rises to her feet and approaches us while shooting the nurse a stern glare."

"If I was truly your mother, dear colleague, I would have taught you how impolite it is to make these kinds of remarks before even introducing us properly."

The nurse acknowledges her words with a cheerful nod and a slightly apologetic gesture.

"This young man next to me is Hisao Nakai whom I'm certain you've heard plenty about by now. My colleague here who wanted to meet you is called Miss Takawa."

"Yumi Takawa. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance, Mister Nakai."

The old woman in front of us makes a graceful bow as the nurse continues.

"Here at Yamaku, our primary focus is to help students deal with the physical implications of their conditions, but in certain cases where a student's condition is the result of an accident of some sort, some additional support can be desired, and if I feel their circumstances warrant it, I usually refer them to Miss Takawa here or one of her co-workers. Eventually the final decision lies with the students, but most of them accept the additional help we offer them here."

I notice how his smile shortly fades for a moment during the last part of his statement, but before I can ponder on whether he had some specific people in mind, his jovial expression returns, and he reaches for the door handle.

"I'm sure the two of you will do fine without me. I'll be going now. See you after your next practice run."

As the nurse closes the door, the woman in front of me gives a tired smile.

"You'll have to excuse my colleague. He is a fine young man, but I believe he enjoys his own jokes a little bit too much sometimes."

She makes an inviting gesture over to the table in the middle of the room.

emi "Hey there! It's been forever since I've seen you here."

hi "Yeah, I've been making some early New Year resolutions and decided to make a serious attempt to get into shape."

"Emi gets up from the bleachers and bounces up and down on her leg blades a few times to test their stability."

emi "Nurse told me about your visit yesterday. He asked me to keep an eye on you, just in case something happens."

"She looks at me quizzically."

emi "What exactly was he talking about?"

"I take a moment to consider how to reply. When I first started attending here, I felt like my arrhythmia was none of other people's business, but over time I've slowly gotten more comfortable with it."

"At this point a few of my classmates know about it. It is probably best to give Emi a run-down of the situation, just in case something does happen."

hi "I'm at this school because I have a heart condition, so for me shaping up is more about avoiding sudden death than it is about avoiding weight gain."

hi "Until recently, I just walked some short distances every now and then, but I recently picked up dating, so I have an additional reason to improve my health and stay in shape. I'd hate to leave a grieving girlfriend behind."

"Emi responds with a smile, but suddenly makes wide eyes and mouths a soundless \"ahah\" as if she just had a revelation of some kind."

emi "Ohhh, so THAT was what the nurse was talking about."

hi "What exactly did he tell you?"

"Emi strikes a pose, puts her hands in the pockets of an imaginative coat and squeezes her eyes shut while contorting her face in a grin that is as wide as it is artificial."

emi "I have reason to believe young Hisao is being driven by the oldest motivation known to man."

"I don't know whether to be amused by Emi's over-the-top (but still frighteningly accurate) imitation of the nurse or annoyed by the insinuation she's making."

hi "I don't really see what's wrong with the desire to stay alive."

"Emi gives me an impish smile that indicates she really isn't buying my attempt to sidestep her remark."

emi "I think he was talking about sex, Hisao. You know, keeping the species going and all?"

hi "Whatever. Can we save the rest of the small talk for the cool down lap?"

"That sounded a little bit grumpier than I intended, but Emi doesn't seem to pay it any heed and cheerfully accepts my suggestion to start the morning run."

"The laps around the track actually turn out better than I expected. The last time I participated in this activity took place a week after I was released from the hospital, and my physical condition was outright pathetic."

"Nowadays, my condition is sufficient to allow me to walk from town back to school without feeling like an old man afterwards. Though I recently discovered it still wasn't good enough."

"I wonder how Emi and the nurse would react if they knew their teasing had an element of truth in it."

"Getting healthy enough to have sex wasn't the only reason behind my resolve to start working out, but the brief hiccup my heart experienced during the night Hanako and I slept together was enough to scare us both for a moment." 
"My condition hanging over our newly formed relationship like a dark cloud was something I wanted to avoid at all costs."
