"The sun is already setting by the time Hanako and I make our way to the parking lot. Hanako received a text message from Akira confirming they landed safely, and Akira is going to drop Lilly off at the school gates."

hi "Are you sure they'll be here soon?"

ha "Y…yes. It should take them less than an hour to get here."

"I was already aching to see Lilly back after two very eventful weeks, but I'm particularly excited to break the news of Hanako and me going out. I'm very curious about how she'll react."

hi "I wonder how we should tell them about us. Maybe we could hold hands when they arrive."

ha "H-hold hands?"

"Hanako seems a bit absentminded ever since we left the school grounds. I wonder if something's wrong. She seemed excited to see Lilly again earlier today."

hi "Yeah. And then leave it to Akira to point that out. Then again, she might just keep it to herself just to mess with Lilly a bit. I wouldn't put it past her."

"Hanako doesn't respond. I notice she's playing with something she's holding in her hand."

hi  "Are you considering wearing that when they arrive?"

ha "I don't really know yet."

hi "It's your choice."

ha "Y…yes."

"Neither of us really knows how to continue the discussion. While the silences between us are no longer as frequent or awkward as they once were, they still rear their head every now and again. This is one of those times."

"We went to town the other day to do some shopping for this evening. Neither of us thought Lilly would have much energy for a party, but we wanted to make the evening a bit special nevertheless and bought a batch of fragrant tea as well as a box of sweets for her."

"Hanako is still toying around with her little trinket as I spot a car heading up the parking lot and approaching us. As it gets closer, I see the distinctive hair color of the Satou sisters behind the windshield."

"The car stops in front of us, and Hanako lets out a small sigh, putting the trinket back in her pocket. Looks like she isn't ready yet to let Akira see her new look."

"The car door opens, and Akira steps out, giving an enthusiastic wave. I have no idea how much energy this woman has, but an intercontinental flight and a ride from the airport to Yamaku seem insufficient to diminish it. Lilly, on the other hand, looks a little worse for wear."

"Hanako's fidgety mood seems to vanish the moment Lilly gets out of the car as she rushes forward and grabs Lilly in a tight hug with a huge smile on her face."

"Lilly is visibly surprised but then recollects herself and returns Hanako's hug with a gentle embrace of her own. I can't help but smile myself as I see this display of unrestricted affection between them."

li "Don't be upset, Hisao. It took me a great deal of effort to convince Hanako that keeping such happy news bottled up is an unhealthy and frustrating thing to do to herself. She seemed genuinely relieved when she finally decided to break the news to us ahead of time."

"Now she's pretending this was all for Hanako's benefit instead of satisfying her own curiosity. Lilly's playful expression shows she is all too eager to take full responsibility for this premature leaking of information, and she doesn't look even a little bit guilty about it."

"Akira merely looks at me with a mischievous grin."

hi "Aren't you at least a little bit tired after travelling for so long?"

hi "Welcome back, Lilly. You're probably tired, but Hanako and I planned a little private party for you to celebrate your return."

hi "If you wish to go to bed right now, we'd understand, but if you can bear with us for another hour or so, we can take the opportunity to catch up."

"Lilly smiles gratefully at us."

"As Lilly puts her second cup of tea down, she lets out a satisfied sigh. She still looks a bit tired, but the caffeine seems to have taken the edge off."

"None of us have said a lot since we reached Lilly's room and Hanako brought in a pot of fragrant tea. It doesn't really matter much. Lilly's presence always seems to turn otherwise uncomfortable silences comfortable."

hi "I suppose what I originally planned to talk about was the news that the two of us are dating now, but with that cat already out of the bag, maybe we could hear some tales from Scotland instead."

of it and puts it into Lilly's hand."

ha "This is a gift Hisao gave me."

"Lilly takes the object and softly runs her sensitive fingertips alongside it. After careful examination,
she smiles."

li "A little hair clip. With a small flower on top. What a nice gift. Were you wearing it when we arrived?"

ha "N..no. Not yet. I could wear it now if you like."

"I look at Hanako as she takes back the clip from Lilly, pauses for a moment, carefully brushes aside the lock of hair that's usually covering the right side of her face and applies the clip to pin it in place."

"I'm still a bit unused to the sight of Hanako's face being completely exposed, but that's more because I've been staring at that lock for so long I've gotten used to it."

"The clip, its flower decoration a miniature version of the one on Hanako's phone strap, was something I gave to her just before our first date with the request to wear it on occasion when we were alone."

"I told her that the sight of her face wasn't going to be a big deal to me, and I wanted to be able to look my own girlfriend in both eyes."

"It also served a more practical purpose as I found it awkward to kiss her with that lock of hair constantly getting in the way. As far as I know, this is the first time she's worn it in the presence of someone other than me." 

"With Lilly, it obviously doesn't make much of a difference."

n "I sit back and nibble on a piece of candy myself as Hanako gives Lilly a brief summary of our date. I can't help but be a bit amused as her retelling actually makes it sound much more spectacular than it 

 really was. In fact, it was probably as tried-and-true a date as we could have managed. This was a bit intentional on my part as I wanted our first date to be as comfortable as possible."

adaption of a book we both read before, so neither of us was very surprised by most of the twists in the
plot, but we had the benefit of having additional discussion material on our way home, and being able
to avoid awkward silences with Hanako is always a good thing. I was even entertained at how
passionate she got for a moment while we were debating the way the director changed a few things
about the ending before slipping back into her usual meek demeanor."

n "One thing about our date that stood out was Hanako's uneasiness with the idea of me paying for everything, so we ended up paying
for each other's meal and movie ticket."

"For a second I want to ask if it wouldn't have been more appropriate to ask Hanako to help her with that, but then I realize that this may very well be Lilly's roundabout way of asking me to stick around for a small talk."

"Which is fine, because there's something I've been meaning to ask her as well. As I start messing with the lock of the suitcase, Lilly sits down on her bed with a tired but cheerful expression on her face."

li "So…you and Hanako…"

hi "Yes, life can take some interesting turns. Thankfully this one was far more positive than most of the other big changes in my life this year."

li "I'm happy you two found each other. Hanako's mood seems to have improved so much compared to how she used to be."

hi "Things could have worked out very differently. By the way, thanks for the advice the other day. I needed that wake-up call pretty badly."

"That's an understatement. Not too long ago, I was thinking of nothing but protecting Hanako from the world around her."

"I was obsessing with her emotional condition and thought of nothing except on how to prevent her from getting hurt more than she had already been."

"I didn't realize how patronizing my disposition must have been until Lilly called me out on it that evening."

"Not only was Lilly's judgment of my behavior spot on, but Hanako was aware of it too and instead of protecting her, my attitude was actively hurting her."

"If anything, I want to forget about this stage of our relationship as soon as possible."

li "I'm glad I could help. Though you two probably would have been able to sort things out yourselves."

hi "I don't think so. Hanako turned out to be aware of my obsessive worrying, and it only served to make her feel worse." 

hi "I'm not sure how things would have turned out if you hadn't told me to back off a bit, but I doubt we'd be where we are now. But there's one thing you said during that phone call that I'd like to ask you about."

show lilly basic_surprised_cas at center
with charachange

li "What is it that you would like to know?"

hi "You told me not to doubt my bond with Hanako, because of some reason or another, but you cut yourself off before elaborating."

li "I promised Hanako not to tell you about how she felt about you. I caught myself in time to avoid breaking that promise."

hi "I'm a bit surprised she told you about that. I would have expected her to keep something like that to herself."

show lilly basic_concerned_cas at center

"Lilly remains silent for a few seconds, carefully choosing her words before answering."

li "She didn't. At least not at first. We frequently spoke about you while spending time together."

li "Shortly after the festival, Hanako suddenly started asking me what I thought of you. She wanted to know whether I…liked you. She was uncharacteristically persistent in her questioning."

hi "And you in return wanted to know why she was so interested?"

li "Yes. After some digging on my part I got her to admit to me that she was in love with you herself."

hi "So it was like she was asking you if it was safe for her to pursue me without becoming a rival to you?"

li "I do not think she had any plans to pursue you. But in the case I liked you as well, she would have tried to push her own feelings away for my benefit…"

show lilly basic_sad_cas at center

"For a moment Lilly looks genuinely sad."

li "…regardless of how you felt about her. That's the kind of person she is."

"That does sound like something Hanako would do. I put a hand on Lilly's shoulder."

hi "Well, things worked out in the end. We got together, and I'm happy I'm able to call her my girlfriend."

show lilly basic_ara_cas at center
with charachange

"Lilly nods silently before smiling inquisitively at me."

li "Hisao…if I may ask. How did you two get together? How did things… fall into place between you two? I asked Hanako, but she wouldn't tell me much about it."

"That's a tricky question. Things falling into place was probably the worst description of how our relationship came to be."

"It was a whole lot more accurate to say things were blown to very tiny bits that we ended up using to piece together something more stable." 

"We ended up playing emotional hide and seek, we ended up hurting each other and pushing each other away and to top it off, we had sexual intercourse for misguided reasons that neither of us was emotionally ready for."

"It wasn't exactly romance novel material we took part in. I have my sincere doubts Lilly would really want to know even half of these things."

hi "The right word would be…messily, Lilly. It's probably better to leave this to your imagination. Please take my word for that."

show lilly basic_surprised_cas at center
with charachange

li "Oh."

"Thank goodness she doesn't pry. One more thing bothered me though. There were many things Hanako told me during our confession in the park that day; many things that I didn't think Lilly was aware of, and some of them applied to her as well." 

"The difficulty with trusting friends Hanako admitted to having was one thing that came to mind, and part of me wants to let Lilly in on this."

"But I'm not certain yet if the risk would be worth it. The things Hanako told me in the park were things she confided in me, because she trusted me." 

"Earning her trust has been a ride through hell, and something tells me it won't be easily regained if she feels I betrayed it."

"With luck and Hanako's slowly growing confidence, she'll be able to improve her friendship with Lilly on her own without me having to meddle in it."

"I finish emptying Lilly's suitcase, stand up and get ready to return to my own dorm room."

hi "Don't worry too much about it. The important thing is we're fine now. Let's focus on what's ahead of us. Starting with a few days in Hokkaido."

"Lilly gets up from the bed and gives a polite bow."

li "Thank you for tonight, Hisao. I'm looking forward to tomorrow."

hi "Me too. Goodnight Lilly."

li "Goodnight Hisao."
